"""
cf-fetch-server — host-side Cloudflare-bypass fetch sidecar for NanoClaw.

Binds 127.0.0.1 only (loopback — never exposed beyond the host) and stays
alive under launchd's KeepAlive=true so the container-side wrapper can fall
back to it whenever agent-browser hits a Cloudflare challenge.

Endpoints:
- GET  /healthz      — liveness probe (pid, host, port, uptime, backend)
- POST /fetch        — JSON body {url, timeout?, headers?} → {status, html, headers, ...}
- GET  /fetch?url=…  — convenience GET form (kept so curl-style probes still work)

Backend (Sub-AC 1.1.2):
- A persistent nodriver Browser is launched at startup on a dedicated asyncio
  event-loop thread. The browser stays warm between requests so that the
  first request after sidecar boot lands under 5s and repeats land under 2s
  (cold-start per-request is rejected by the Seed's latency budget).
- Webshare residential-proxy credentials are loaded from the host .env via
  CF_FETCH_SERVER_ENV_FILE (HTTP_PROXY_URL=...) — the credentials never enter
  the container.
- Cloudflare challenges are detected via title heuristics (Just a moment /
  Attention required / Cloudflare) and resolved via nodriver's verify_cf()
  helper. The pattern is ported from
  .claude/skills/request-proxy/request_proxy.py::_visit_page_async.
- If nodriver / pyvirtualdisplay are not importable on the host's Python the
  sidecar degrades to a stub backend (backend="stub") so launchd persistence
  (Verification D) is preserved even before the python deps are installed.

# (a) Concurrency / queueing
#
# nodriver drives a single Chromium process on a single asyncio loop, so
# unbounded /fetch concurrency would just queue inside the loop with no
# backpressure to the HTTP client (the requesting agent in the container
# would time out without ever knowing it was queued). MAX_CONCURRENT caps
# the number of /fetch operations that can be in-flight on the warm browser
# simultaneously; QUEUE_WAIT_S is how long an arriving request will block
# for a slot before the sidecar returns 503 and lets the client decide.
#
# Default (3) is conservative on purpose: each in-flight tab is its own
# CDP session against the same Chromium process and CF challenge-solving
# briefly drives the renderer hot, so over-parallelising hurts latency
# more than serial requests do.

# Period (seconds) at which a background thread checks whether the warm
# browser is still alive and restarts it if it isn't. 0 disables the
# watchdog (useful for tests / foreground debugging where you want a
# crash to be permanent so it surfaces).
WATCHDOG_INTERVAL_S = float(os.environ.get("CF_FETCH_SERVER_WATCHDOG_INTERVAL", "30"))

# (c) Shutdown drain

# When SIGTERM/SIGINT arrives we let in-flight /fetch requests finish for

# default ExitTimeOut is 20s, so we stay well under that.

# (d) Per-fetch retry-after-crash budget

# Webshare proxy wiring (Sub-AC 1.1.3)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The Seed wires a single Webshare residential-proxy URL into the nodriver
# browser context so every request leaves the host through the rotating
# proxy. The credentials live ONLY on the host — they are loaded from the
# launchd plist's EnvironmentVariables (which install.sh seeds from
# ~/Desktop/nanoclaw/.env at install time) and never enter the container.
#
# Rotation strategy:
#   - Webshare's residential proxy rotates exit IPs per TCP connection.
#   - Each /fetch opens a NEW tab on the warm browser (`browser.get(...,
#     new_tab=True)`), so each request gets fresh sockets and therefore a
#     fresh exit IP without restarting the browser. This satisfies the Seed
#     latency budget (warm browser stays up between requests, <2s repeats).
#   - For sticky-session use cases (e.g. login flows) the operator can put a
#     `-session-{id}` suffix in the username portion of HTTP_PROXY_URL —
#     no code change needed; we pass the parsed user/pass through verbatim
#     to the CDP Fetch.continueWithAuth handler.
#
# Per-tab proxy auth is wired via the Chrome DevTools Protocol's Fetch
# domain (`Fetch.enable(handle_auth_requests=True)` + `Fetch.requestPaused`
# + `Fetch.authRequired`). Chromium's `--proxy-server` flag does not accept
# embedded credentials in the URL form (`user:pass@host:port`) — the
# credentials must be supplied at runtime via this CDP auth handshake.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

class _ConcurrencyGate:
    """Bounded semaphore wrapper with introspection for /healthz.

    Each /fetch handler acquires a slot before driving the warm browser.
    If MAX_CONCURRENT slots are already in use the handler blocks for up
    to QUEUE_WAIT_S; if the slot still isn't available it returns 503 to
    the caller so the container wrapper can decide whether to retry.

    Why a gate at all when the browser already serialises CDP I/O?
      - Each /fetch opens a fresh tab, so without a cap N concurrent
        requests spawn N concurrent tabs and N concurrent verify_cf()
        loops. That fans out CPU on the host AND eats N proxy-rotation
        slots on Webshare. Capping this protects both budgets.
      - Without backpressure to the HTTP client, the requesting agent in
        the container would never know it was queued — it would just
        time out waiting on a hung response. Returning 503 after
        QUEUE_WAIT_S lets the agent degrade gracefully (e.g. fall back
        to the agent-browser path or retry later).

    `total_served` and `rejected_total` are monotonic counters surfaced
    on /healthz so an operator can spot pile-ups before they become
    user-visible.
